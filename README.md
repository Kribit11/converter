Converter for Time/Temperature/Length

This webpage can convert a huge amount of times from centuries to quectoseconds! It converts a small amount of temperatures and length as well. 

> For **length:** (ascending order)
> - centermeters
> - meters

> For **temperature:** 
> - Celsius
> - Fahrenheit
> - Kelvin

> For **time:** (ascending order)
> - plank time
> - quectoseconds
> - rontoseconds
> - yoctoseconds
> - zeptoseconds
> - attoseconds
> - femtoseconds
> - picoseconds
> - nanoseconds
> - microseconds
> - milliseconds
> - centiseconds
> - deciseconds
> - seconds
> - 

## Known glitches

> For **length:**
> - only meters and centermeters are added - more will be added

> For **temperature:**
> - actually works as intended

> For **time:**
> - the quectosecond and rontosecond return as numbers like '9.999999999999999e+29' & '9.999999999999998e+23'
> - years are exactly 365 instead of however its meant to be 
> - decades and centuries are also off because of leap years
> - months not added yet

> For **home page:**
> - The flex doesn't work as intended

## update log
 
> update **5**
> - fixed some broken units
>   - Kelvin
>   - centermeter & meter
> - made the project public!!
> - added credits and grammar checked README.md


## Credits

> Me, [kribit](https://linktr.ee/kribit) and the help of AI for some very obvious errors i made
