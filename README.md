Converter for Time/Temperature/Length

This webpage can convert a huge amount of times from centuries to quectoseconds! It converts a small amount of temperatures and length as well. 

> For **length** we have: (ascending order)
> - centermeters
> - meters

> For **temperature** we have:
> - Celsius
> - Fahrenheit
> - Kelvin

> For **time** we have: (ascending order)
> - plank time
> - quectoseconds
> - rontoseconds
> - yoctoseconds
> - zeptoseconds
> - attoseconds
> - femtoseconds
> - picoseconds
> - nanoseconds
> - microseconds
> - milliseconds
> - centiseconds
> - deciseconds
> - seconds

## Known glitches

> For **length:**
> - doesn't currently work at converting anything as it returns as null
> - only meters and centermeters are added

> For **temperature:**
> - the Kelvin unit doesn't work and returns as null 
> - Kelvin to Fahrenheit always returns as 32 degrees

> For **time:**
> - the quectosecond and rontosecond return as numbers like '9.999999999999999e+29' & '9.999999999999998e+23'

> For **home page:**
> - The flex doesn't work as intended
