Converter for Time/Temperature/Length

This webpage can convert a huge amount of times from centuries to quectoseconds! It converts a small amount of temperatures and length as well. 

The main reason for the creation of this website is for STEM club. I am recreating time it self. I thought it would be helpful if I had a converter to convert between actulal times (like seconds and minutes) to my recreated and *better* times. I have only done a little work on the actual STEM project though... 

> For **length:** (ascending order)
> - centermeters
> - meters

> For **temperature:** 
> - Celsius
> - Fahrenheit
> - Kelvin

> For **time:** (ascending order)
> - plank time
> - quectoseconds
> - rontoseconds
> - yoctoseconds
> - zeptoseconds
> - attoseconds
> - femtoseconds
> - picoseconds
> - nanoseconds
> - microseconds
> - milliseconds
> - centiseconds
> - deciseconds
> - seconds

## Known glitches

> For **length:**
> - only meters and centermeters are added - more will be added
> - doesn't work now i don't even know why...

> For **temperature:**
> - actually works as intended

> For **time:**
> - the quectosecond and rontosecond return as numbers like '9.999999999999999e+29' & '9.999999999999998e+23'
> - years are exactly 365 instead of however its meant to be 
> - decades and centuries are also off because of leap years
> - months not added yet

> For **home page:**
> - The flex doesn't work as intended

## main updates
 
> update **5**
> - fixed some broken units
>   - Kelvin

> - made the project public!!
> - added credits and grammar checked the README .md file
>
> update **6**
> - added the live time to the main page ([stole from here](https://iq.opengenus.org/display-live-time-and-date-in-html/))


## Credits

> Me, [kribit](https://linktr.ee/kribit) and the help of AI for some very obvious errors i made that i should have picked up on 
>
> (TBH most of the errrors were grammar mistakes like capitals but i still messed it up)
